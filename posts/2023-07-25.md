As I begin to use this site to publish actually usable open-source tools, it's clear that a full revamp is necessary, and also that I'll need to leave IPFS. Hosting is crazy expensive there when I could be much more easily hosting with Vercel. I hate to make the site less decentralized to make it cheaper for myself, but I appreciate the irony of corporate tools making open sourcing much easier.

Besides, I think the tools I'm publishing soon will be worth it and take this site to a new place. Staying optimistic!

New links are up:
**[cooperreed.me](https://cooperreed.me/)** and **[cooperability.com](https://cooperability.com/)** both redirect to cooperability.vercel.app.

This saves me the pinata hosting costs; I'll be back up on IPFS once I find a way to monetize.

Yours,

- **Cooper**
