This project involved a major restoration and renovation to an historic home intended to bring it back to 1920’s glamour.  Original public spaces were refurbished while inappropriately remodeled bathrooms and bedrooms were reconfigured to provide more generous spaces, better flow, and views throughout.  The kitchen was opened up by incorporating an unused maid’s rooms.  Likewise an exterior loggia and theater were created out of a large rec room.  Many salvaged materials were introduced (such as stained glass, antique tiles and wrought iron) to provide an authentic patina.  Custom designed tile at the new bathrooms, exterior railings, mouldings, etc. complete the effect.  A new pool deck, walls, fountain, terracing and landscaping make the exteriors more usable and resort-like.  A guest house was also refurbished.
