This historic downtown building (named for its owner, Rita Hayworthâ€™s father) was brought back to life, converting it into writing and production offices for an entertainment company.  As a landmarked building, the comprehensive remodel was done according to Department of Interiors standards and involved gutting the dilapidated chopped up spaces into cohesive work environments while maintaining almost all the original features.  The program includes a new lobby, multiple individual offices, editing and production spaces, secretarial bullpens, restrooms, conference rooms, an elevator, etc.. The original dance ballroom was reimagined as a flexible communal dining space and screening room, complete with kitchen, pantry, and adjacent nursery for employees.  The project also involved restoring the exterior and interior historic features, replacing windows, and bringing the entire building up to current standards in terms of technology, plumbing, electrical, mechanical systems, and energy efficiency.  The newer modern elements play off the historic ones and the detailed finishes and fixtures reflect the style and detail of the original building.
