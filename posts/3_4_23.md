I've been thinking a lot lately about what it means to consistently put effort toward so many projects each day. Simply writing tasks out consistently boosts my ability to track multiple threads.

Is a Github graph a promise made to others? It helped me to think of it as a promise made to myself.

There's so little free time in life where you can truly sit down and build. We may build for others, or for pay, or to support the ones we love, but at the end of each day we sleep with data swimming in our heads.

Can my excitement for my goals keep me pushing through the endless river of obstacles in life? It helps me to think that it can.

Yours,
