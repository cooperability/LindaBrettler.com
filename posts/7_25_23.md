As I begin to use this site to publish actually usable open-source tools, it's clear that a full revamp is necessary, and also that I'll need to leave IPFS. Hosting is crazy expensive there when I could be much more easily hosting with Vercel. I hate to make the site less decentralized to make it cheaper for myself, but I appreciate the irony of corporate tools making open sourcing much easier.

Besides, I think the tools I'm publishing soon will be worth it and take this site to a new place. Staying optimistic!

Yours,
