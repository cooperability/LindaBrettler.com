title: "First Webpage: IPFS Static HTML"
date: "2022-10-03"
---

Foundations have been laid! This site now serves from **[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)**(about), a decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. In order to shorten loading times I've hosted through **[Piñata Cloud](https://www.pinata.cloud/)**(about), a set of computers and technologies making IPFS development more comprehensive. 

Next steps are a frontend, a backend, and infrastructure in general.

The single-page HTML site will forever be accessible from these two links: **[Piñata](https://yellow-hollow-caterpillar-535.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTyH3HHSADsTQ7GHQAuQVeur9t4DSkGbhBKyXAAsi1vWj/)**(faster) and **[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTyH3HHSADsTQ7GHQAuQVeur9t4DSkGbhBKyXAAsi1vWj/)**(slower).

I'll also leave the **[Github repository](https://github.com/cooperability/MySite1-HTML-IPFS)** from this stage here as a template.


I'm so happy we're running! More soon.

Yours,
- **Cooper**
