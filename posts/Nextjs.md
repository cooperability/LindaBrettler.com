After a couple nights of work, I'm finally set up on **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**! While I'm still exporting static HTML from Next, it's really nice to have a more robust front-end on this thing. Unfortunately, static HTML means for now, we can't use Next's fancy **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering** features.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.
