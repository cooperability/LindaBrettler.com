Next has proven severely difficult. I'm getting bogged down working on my thesis in NLP as well.

Next steps are a frontend, a backend, and infrastructure in general.

The single-page HTML site will forever be accessible from these two links: **[Pi√±ata](https://yellow-hollow-caterpillar-535.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTyH3HHSADsTQ7GHQAuQVeur9t4DSkGbhBKyXAAsi1vWj/)**(faster) and **[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTyH3HHSADsTQ7GHQAuQVeur9t4DSkGbhBKyXAAsi1vWj/)**(slower).

I'll also leave the **[Github repository](https://github.com/cooperability/MySite1-HTML-IPFS)** from this stage here as a template.

Yours,

- **Cooper**
