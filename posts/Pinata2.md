I got a dark/light mode up and running! More to follow soon I hope...looking at a way I can duplicate a lot of these site elements to reimplement elsewhere on more polished products. Looking forward to bigger steps as I get more comfortable with Next/Typescript stack. Also debating a redeploy to AWS for the credentials and all that. Idk we'll see. Quote board should go up soon too.

Yours,
